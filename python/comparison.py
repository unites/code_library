# initializing list and convert into set object

# difference_update()			Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
# discard()						Remove the specified item
# intersection()				Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
# intersection_update()			Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
# isdisjoint()					Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
# issubset()					Returns whether another set contains this set or not
# issuperset()					Returns whether this set contains another set or not
# pop()							Removes an element from the set
# remove()						Removes the specified element
# symmetric_difference()		Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
# symmetric_difference_update()	inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
# union()						Return a set containing the union of sets
# update()						Update the set with the union of this set and others
